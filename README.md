# RPG AGENTS

A variation of the CAMEL Agents as created in the [Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agent_simulations/camel_role_playing.html) library.

I've hooked this up to Discord as seen in this [video](https://twitter.com/AI_Citizen/status/1648956371268952065?s=20)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

copy the .env.example to .env and add your OpenAI API key

## Usage

```bash
python rpg_agents.py
```
